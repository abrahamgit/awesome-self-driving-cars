## Bascis
Developing self driving cars requires many skill which mostly revolves around mobile robotics (percption, localization, path planning, controls, simulations) but can be very different, like end-to-end Deep Learning. I also sometimes requires knowledge of vehicle design, safety ... 

## Basic Software Library
1. ROS
2. OpenCV
3. PCL

## Datasets
* [KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php) - 6 hours of traffic scenarios at 10-100 Hz using a variety of sensor modalities such as highresolution
* [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets) - Udacity driving datasets released for [Udacity Challenges](https://www.udacity.com/self-driving-car). Contains ROSBAG training data. (~80 GB).
* [Oxford's Robotic Car](http://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk/) - over 100 repetitions of a consistent route through Oxford, UK, captured over a period of over a year. The dataset captures many different combinations of weather, traffic and pedestrians, along with longer term changes such as construction and roadworks.

## Open Source Software

* [Autoware](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware) - Integrated open-source software for urban autonomous driving.
* [Comma.ai Openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) - an open source driving agent.
* [Stanford Driving Software](https://sourceforge.net/projects/stanforddriving/) - Software Infrastructure for Stanford's Autonomous Vehicles.
* [GTA Robotics SDC Environment](https://github.com/OSSDC/self-driving-car-1) - development environment ready for Udacity Self Driving Car (SDC) Challenges.
* [The OSCC Project](http://oscc.io/) - A by-wire control kit for autonomous vehicle development.
